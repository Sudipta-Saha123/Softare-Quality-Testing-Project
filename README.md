# Softare-Quality-Testing- Group-Project

Project Overview: 
This project aims to demonstrate the usage of Selenium IDE for testing the Upwork website. The Selenium IDE is a browser automation tool that allows testers to record and playback interactions with the browser. In this project, we have created various test cases to ensure the functionality and reliability of the Upwork website.
Prerequisites

Before running the test cases, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

    Install the Selenium IDE extension for your preferred browser (Chrome or Firefox).
    Ensure the browser is up to date.

Running the Test Cases

To run the test cases:

    Open the Selenium IDE extension in your browser.
    Import the provided test suite file (Travel Management System) into Selenium IDE.
    Start the test execution by clicking on the play button or by selecting individual test cases and running them one by one.

Reporting

After running the test cases, a report will be generated within the Selenium IDE containing detailed information about the test execution, including any failures or errors encountered during the testing process.
